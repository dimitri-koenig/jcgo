# jcgo
JSON Convert in Go

`jcgo` JSONifies the output of many CLI tools, file-types, and common strings for easier parsing in scripts.

This project is inspired by the Python tool [jc](https://github.com/kellyjonbrazil/jc) from Kelly Brazil.
The initial goal of this project is to provide similar functionality to `jc` but in Go, with a focus on performance (and me learning Go).

## Roadmap

* Initial version with basic functionality, supporting all `git log` features
* Add support for more common commands
* Add documentation and examples
